```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

### importing the data
```{r}
esport <- read.csv("ESport_Earnings.csv")
View(esport)
```

### creating a barplot of the total amount of money made divided by 10000 (for better visualization) for each genre
```{r}



ggplot(esport, aes(x=TotalMoney/10000, y=Genre,  fill=Genre)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
labs(title = "Total Money for each Genre divided by 10000" ,
subtitle = "Source: Esports Earnings by various Professional Gaming Tournaments" ,
x = "Total money earned" ,
y = "Genre")


```



### pie Chart of the number of players for each tournament 
```{r}
ggplot(esport, aes(x="", y=PlayerNo, fill=Genre, counts = PlayerNo)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
labs(title = "Pie Chart of the Nmber of players for each tournament" ,
subtitle = "Source: Esports Earnings by various Professional Gaming Tournaments" ,
x = "" ,
y = "Number of Players")
```



### line plot of the number of the total earnings vs number of tournaments
```{r}
ggplot(data = esport , aes(x = TournamentNo , y = TotalMoney/10000)) +
geom_point(color = "blue")  +
  geom_smooth(color = "red")+
labs(title = "Total money vs. Tournament Number" ,
subtitle = "Source: Esports Earnings by various Professional Gaming Tournaments" ,
x = "Tournament Number" ,
y = "Total Money")

```

### scatterplot of the amount of money based on the release year of each game
```{r}


ggplot(data = esport , aes(x = Releaseyear , y = TotalMoney)) +
geom_point(color = "red")  +
labs(title = "Total Money vs. Release Year" ,
subtitle = "Source: Esports Earnings by various Professional Gaming Tournaments" ,
x = "Release Year" ,
y = "Total Money")
